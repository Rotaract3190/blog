“Littering in public is something that I cannot stand at all. It annoys the living hell out of me. Whenever I see people peeing or spitting in public I yell at them. People around me ask me not to do that because they are scared about me getting into trouble. When I yell at people my friends laugh at that and I wonder what’s funny about littering in public. It’s funny how people are ignorant about these things. One day, a girl asks me to mind my business when I ask her father not to spit in public. I guess ignorance isn’t always bliss.
This is the reason that I got into social service. I work for an NGO called “Let’s be the change”. I also gather my street kids and clean up the street regularly and they are always excited about it. This is also the reason why I joined Rotaract. It serves my hunger to do good to the society and keep my surroundings clean.

We have only one Earth to live on. Let’s try and save it!

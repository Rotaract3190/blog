“Back then, when I was in school, I had to travel by bus every day which meant a good five minutes’ walk to the bus stop. On that path, was this hut where an old homeless woman used to live with a stray dog. She used to beg for a living and sometimes could not even afford food. One day I saw the dog digging into a pile of dump that is stacked next to that hut. It took out what looked like thrown away food and then quickly rushed to the woman to hand her over the food.
When I think of what happened back there, I always wonder as to what was running through the mind of that dog? I mean, if I were a hungry dog who found some food, I’d have thought about filling my stomach first but this dog actually shared its food with that woman. It made me think that we as human beings sometimes miss out on such simple values in life. If a hungry stray dog could share its food with that woman, then why could I not share a simple thing like a chocolate with my own friend?”

Something to think about, right?

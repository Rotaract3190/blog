“My friends and I always hang out at this bus stop near my college. Near that bus stop is a bank and in that bank works a blind person who must be around 35 years old. I always noticed that no one even tried to help him out. One day, I helped him out go around the place and get on to a bus. The next day another friend of mine joined me and the next day the rest did. The blind guy started talking to us and telling us his stories and we did too. We grew close to each other and now we were all his friends. He grew so fond of us that he started asking for us, whenever he didn’t find us there.

If helping out one person gives us such immense happiness and satisfaction, imagine the kind of happiness that would rain down upon us by helping out more number of people. It is my dream to one day start an NGO of my own and helping out people is what I want to do.

This is what drives me… What about you?”

Best Beaches in the World to Party in your 20s

Written by Katie Tobias

Like to party in paradise? Here at Base we have travelled far and wide and if there is one thing we know... it's how to party! Travelling the world is something we believe every young 20 year old should do at some point in their life... so why not throw in a good old fashioned party while you're at it? So here it is... our top 20 best beaches in the world to party whilst in your 20s (and 30s, and 40s...). So get ready to soak up the sun, sip on a cocktail (or ten) and dance the night away...



1. Copacabana Beach, Rio, Brazil



"At the Copa, Copacabana... the hottest spot north of Havana" - Copacabana Beach needs no introduction.



2. Super Paradise, Mykonos, Greece



Why we LOVE Super Paradise? This popular little slice of paradise has become quite the hot spot for Gay and Bi travellers. To the right of Super Paradise is a nude beach (also extremely gay friendly) and the tunes kick off at around 4:00PM... that's when the party really gets started!



3. Praia de Batata, Lagos, Portugal



There are many beautiful beaches that line the Algarve coastline in Lagos but the reason we just had to include Praia de Batata (also known and Potato Beach) is for the small (but crazy) music festivals that take place there throughout summer. The beach is tucked away between towering cliffs - paradise!



4. South Beach, Miami, USA



Nicknamed SoBe and commonly referred to as America's sexiest city, Miami knows how to party. With white sands, blue waters, art deco buildings and a thriving nightlife, we just HAD to throw South Beach into the mix. Take us there NOW!



5. Palolem Beach, Goa, India



Goa became popular in the late 1960s as the Hippie Hashish Trail extended through Europe, Turkey, Afghanistan, Nepal and finally, ending in Goa. As the selling of Marijuana became illegal in Kathmandu, travellers began to make their way towards Goa, following rumours of pristine, untouched beaches, drugs and of course, freedom. Palolem Beach is one of the most popular beaches in Goa and is well known for its epic trance parties. We'll catch ya on the other side!



6. Cabo San Lucas, Mexico



One word. Spring Break! Cabo San Lucas has forever been a popular party destination for US youngsters and the town knows how to put on a good ol' beach party! Oh - and it's beautiful. Hola Mexico!



7. Haad Rin Beach, Koh Phangan, Thailand



If you can get past the annoyingly pumped up Bintang singlet sporting Aussies on their first ever overseas trip, Haad Rin Beach is home to the ever famous Full Moon Party. Cheap Buckets, Loud Music and bars, bars and more bars line this paradise. Tip: head to Mushroom Mountain for the after party... our fav!



8. Cala Jondal, Ibiza, Spain



Cue endless movie and song quotes... "We're going to Ibiza" - thank you Vengaboys (guilty pleasure of ours), "It's a FLOATER" - who can forget that unforgettable Kevin and Perry moment? We won't waste our time here. You know what Ibiza is all about!



9. Zrce Beach, Novalja, Croatia



"The Ibiza of the Croatian Coast" is located on the island of Pag on the northern side of the coast with 24 hour clubs, beach bars and festivals. Awww yeah!



10. Gordon Beach, Tel Aviv, Israel



Overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, Gordon Beach plays host to some pretty epic summer festivals. Further down the coastline past Jerusalem Beach, the beaches tend to attract hipsters and hippies with all out drum circles.



11. Bikini Beach, La Barra, Punta del Este, Uruguay



Uruguay is fast becoming more and more popular with South American travellers seeking to get away from the tourist epicenters, La Barra also being a popular surf destination. The drinks are cheap, the locals are friendly and the coastal town of La Barra is unspoiled paradise with 24 hour fiestas - way off the beaten track but well worth it! It's also a popular spot for models and famous peeps... keep on the lookout.



12. White Beach, Boracay, Philippines



You've all seen the postcard like images of White Beach on Boracay Island right? If not, picture white sand, turquoise waters and palm trees. In a nutshell... it's paradise! Not only are there loads of water sports and activities on offer, the main beach on Boracay Island always has a party going on. So sit back on your beach front bean bag, sip on a cocktail and wait for the night to unravel.



13. Mancora, Peru



Peru, Peru... we love you! Most travellers visiting South America will enter and exit from Lima to embark on the great Machu Picchu trail. Mancora is located about 1,100km north of Lima and just below the border of Ecuador. Good surf. Cheap drinks. Small town party vibe 7 nights a week.



14. Havana, Cuba



The tourist gates to Havana are now well and truly open, but one thing this city knew how to do well before the gush of tourism was to party in their own, unique, Cuban way. One thing the Cubans know how to do is throw a good old fashioned 'free to all' street party. The city has just about every type of bar, club, pub and night club to suit any traveller's taste. Tip: master the Salsa!



15. San Juan del Sur, Nicagura



Ever heard of Sunday Funday? No? Well you're missing out... Nicagura's surf side town of San Juan del Sur is around 20 minutes north of the country's border. Think beach front hostels, bars and every Sunday (Funday) - a pool party. Woo!



16. St Tropez, France



Sitting by the French Riveria, St Tropez is well known for its all night parties, upmarket nightclubs, classy cocktails and tendency to attract famous peeps. The seaside town which was once a fishing village began to attract 'new wave' artists in the 1960s and has since transformed into a stylish, sexy and chic town. Champagne anyone?



17. Magnetic Island, Australia



A popular island getaway on Australia's east coast, Magnetic Island is absolute paradise and Base Backpackers is home to the only beach front bar in Australia. Not only are there loads of amazing beaches, Koalas and walking trails, but the island is home to Australia's very own Full Moon Party. Hello paradise.





18. Waikiki, Hawaii



Mmm... Honolulu. Dreamy paradise, epic surf and a great night life. Waikiki is well known for its beach parties, beach front bars, block parties and festivals. The best bit? Flights to Hawaii are now super cheap from Australia. BOOM!



19. Beachcomber Island, Fiji



Beachcomber is a popular island getaway for island hoppers visiting Fiji. The clientele on the island is primarily young backpackers and the hostel sports a 100+ Bure Dorm room! Every night is a party in paradise and the beaches surrounding this quaint little slice of sandy goodness are the perfect place to sunbathe away the hangover. Tip: Try the Kava!



20. Kuta & Seminyak, Bali, Indonesia



Soooo many bars, so little time! Bali is like a playground for adults - great surf, rainforest, scuba diving, snorkelling, laidback locals and islands. As touristy as Bali is, it is a great place to party and chill all in the one destination.



Excited? We are! How many have you got left to tick off the list?

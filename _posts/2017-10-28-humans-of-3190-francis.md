“As a kid, I was very athletic but during ninth grade, I was diagnosed with Dengue and I had to be rushed to the hospital for any chances of survival. I was damn terrified but I never gave up. I finally got out of it. The medicines I took had a side effect and I slowly started gaining weight. By the time I was in second year of engineering, I was this giant blob of mass and that’s when the body shaming began. I couldn’t cope up with anything and I slowly started slipping into depression but I dug my way through this as well.

Throughout all these hassles, fitness had a strong role to play in my life. I believe that fitness not only changes ones physical ability to do things but also changes their mentality towards life. They start believing in themselves and start respecting people who are fit because they know how difficult it is to achieve something like that. I started running marathons and I recently finished a 21k marathon. The emotions that cook up while running a marathon is something that everyone should experience. Initially, you are one with the crowd. You are full of energy. Later, your body is depleted of all its energy and it's all about the mental strength. The final part of the marathon is when your body wants to give up but your brain pushes hard and when you see the finish line all those cooked up emotions appear. The joy and satisfaction that I felt when I completed the marathon is irreplaceable. My eyes teared up. I believe that life too is the same. In the beginning there are people with you but as you keep going ahead, they reduce in number and in the end, only you are responsible for the outcome that you are gonna face. Through this journey, I have figured out that the people who rush to your help are the ones who have gone through it the most.

I recently joined Rotaract and that was because of this amazing Rotaractor that I met in a book club. Rotaract is now my second home. So when life knocks at your door, take the opportunity no matter what."

“My father is an ex-serviceman in the Indian army and so my schooling was basically Kendriya Vidyalaya and that is where everything started. I was pushed into the scouts & guides coz of my father. Up to a certain level it was all going good but during Rajya Puraskar, I couldn’t keep up with the level of discipline there. Eventually I was disqualified. It was the first blow that I faced; something that I worked hard for but couldn’t achieve. Everyone was dejected. Later I was pushed into sports. It was a good run there as well up till a certain point of time. I couldn’t gel with the other team members and I again had to quit playing. Another blow, another dejection. By this time I was in the grove of doing things. I couldn’t sit back. I started learning Taekwondo and that too was a good run. The pattern was repetitive though. I made it till the nationals but then was disqualified due to the lack of discipline. By this time it had become a pattern. My pre-grad was in MES College. Getting an admission here was a task but due to the various quotas (defense, sports and scouts & guides) they were happy to have me there. First few months went by without any hassles. But then things started taking a toll again. Problems started kicking in one after the other. So to tackle that, I started living life in my way-bunking, hanging out, watch movies, attend parties. By the end of the first year, I had flunked PCMB. 

By the end of first year, I was presented a chance to be a part of the scouts and guides again. It was a boon. The republic day camp was a dream for many NCC cadets. Around 90,000 cadets from Karnataka take part in it out of which 100 get through. Rigorous processes for the selection was very difficult with 10 days of training. I somehow got through two camps and that is when I thought I could get through. Despite of all my stupidity I somehow survived up till midway of the camps. At that point of time they literally kicked me out. Later I got a call from my commanding officer who asked me to take up a drill test; went on pretty well. I got a second chance and that’s when I got my game up. I had to buck up now because this was something I couldn’t give up on. So I got to the post of parade commander and it was all going pretty good. Confidence was now one of my strong virtues. I got a chance to emmcee a few events as well. When I got back to MES after all this, I was not allowed to continue science but was given a commerce seat.

So once I graduated out of MES, and got into B.Com, things started going the right way. I knew what ego and laziness could do to one and I stayed away from it. I now knew what failure tasted like. A few cadets who I trained are now captains in the army. It feels good when one hears such things.

Now I am pursuing my Masters, I did my B.A in journalism, I hold two diploma degrees, I am working on a thesis to pursue a PhD degree, I have finished my personality development courses, I have learnt three foreign languages, have cleared my interview for the armed forces and have job offers of around 6 firms. So when I think back to that phase in my life, I only see it as a force that pushed me to get where I am today. My aim is to be in a place where I can wear a uniform.”

Isn’t failure really the stepping stone to success?

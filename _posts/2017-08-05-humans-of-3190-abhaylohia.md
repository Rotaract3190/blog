“It was when I was seven years old that I lost my 4 year old younger sister to polio. I was very young. I couldn’t comprehend the concepts of life and death. All I did was, wait for her every day. I always dreamt of becoming a doctor so that I could help my sister get rid of the stupid disease. Another thing is that, as a kid I was always bullied. People used to call me names either because of my height or because of my skin complexion and this had gone on throughout my school life. Now you must be wondering why is this guy sharing all of this with us?

Well, after I graduated from my undergrad college, I was introduced to this dynamic phenomenon called Rotaract. This is when I learnt about the efforts of Rotary and Rotaract to eradicate polio from the world. From that moment on, I took Rotaract seriously and worked hard in order to help people around me. All I wanted was for people to not suffer like my sister had done. Rotaract not only provided me with a way to help others but also to help myself. It gave an extra boost to my confidence and transformed me from a tiny bullied kid to the President of my Rotaract club. So as I think of taking up the responsibility of leading a crowd of 100 Rotaractors this year, all I can say is that my story will always be that of Rotaract and also that Rotaract is a strong driving force towards a better tomorrow.”

“It was May and the summer heat was at the peak. My company had organised an event and it turned out to be a huge success. However, after that point, business started going downhill much like many other things in life. This was when I realised that I needed to do something with my life and so I started looking for cool things that I could do. One day, I contacted one of my Dad’s colleagues, who is a Rotarian and said, “Uncle, I want to join Rotaract. I don’t know what it is, I don’t know where it is but I want to be a part of it,” and that is how I got in. Soon, I was offered to attend their theatre workshops and be a part of their theatre group. I, however, wasn’t interested but on second thought, there was nothing for me to lose. I gave it a shot.

When I attended my first workshop, I met this elderly man who had a very peculiar. Mr Vijay Padaki, also known as the Grand Old Man of Theatre, was there to teach us. After that, I kept attended workshops every Sunday. One fine day he approached me and offered me a role in one of the plays and I took it. My very first role was that of a Chief Minister in a play that was about a series of short stories written by Rabindranath Tagore called “Robi’s Garden.” Since then, I have never looked back and I have been a part of about seven plays in a span of one year. This transformation, for a guy who was extremely shy and could not act, is equivalent to a wonder. As a kid, I always hid under the bed whenever there were guests at our place but now it is a completely different scenario. Theatre has boosted my confidence to a new level and it has helped me cope up with the disturbed state that I was in. What matters is the attitude, the way that one looks at everything. Certain things change people’s attitude in a certain way and the theatre was that for me.

So, the moral of the story is that no matter what people are going through in life, as long as they have that one thing to go back to, they will always be fine. As a wise person once said, “there’s a light at the end of every tunnel.”

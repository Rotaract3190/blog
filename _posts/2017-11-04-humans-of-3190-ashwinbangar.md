“My sister and I lived with my Grandpa and a year ago, he passed away. The day that this happened still haunts me. I was at work when I got a call from the hospital and had to rush there. I saw my sister crying and at that moment I couldn’t react. I just froze for an hour or so and this was something that I cannot comprehend till date. Grandpa was someone who always used to help people and he was the kind of man who believed in service and that is what inspires me to do things. I always try to follow his footsteps and that was one of the reasons why I joined Rotaract as well. He had opened a school for orphans with one of his acquaintances which was run and maintained by the two of them. Grandpa never worked towards recognition and that is something I strongly believe as well. Working towards happiness of others and finding joy in that is a thought that I respect a lot. One should always be happy about doing something otherwise it is pointless, I believe.

Grandpa was a constant support to me in everything I did. I was a part of a team which was taking part in an event called the Efficycle where we had to build our own cycle. So a day before the event, the cycle that we had built had broken down and it obviously needed fixing. The timing was the most horrible back then because this happened at around midnight. So we were roaming around in the streets of Chandigarh looking for any possible way to fix our cycle so that we could take part in the event. Hope is a difficult thing to maintain when things don’t go your way and we could feel the hope slipping out slowly but I believe in the quote, "Hope is a good thing, and no good thing ever dies" and a few of us believed in ourselves and we found a proficient repairman who helped us fix the cycle in no time (with him doing most of the work) and we could finally register our team for the next day’s event. 

Grandpa always asked me to believe in myself because that is when things will fall in place. We could have given up and gone back but because we believed, we were able to participate in the event and that ladies and gentlemen is what I want you all to do-Believe in yourself no matter what and do that what makes you happy!”

“I kind of still regret about what I am going to narrate now. This happened when I was studying in 10th grade. The incident happened when I was walking back home from tution at 6 in the morning and walking in front of me was another woman. After a while we heard a loud scream of a girl. We turned back to check what was happening and there we saw a girl looking out the window of the car and screaming for help. Yes, she was getting raped. I froze that instant and didn’t know what to do. I was in such a shock I couldn’t move a muscle. The helplessness of that girl pushed me to do anything that was in my capacity but fear had gotten the better of me. The girl inside the car even tried to get out of the car but the people in the car forced her back in and slammed the door. I tried to register any possible information about the vehicle but it didn’t even have a number plate either.

The other woman started screaming and yelling at the people in the car but the driver just put his hand outside the window and waved it in a gesture that seemed like a warning. To this day I regret not being able to help that girl and that gives me nightmares. Even though I have grown as a person and I have grown stronger now, I still wish I had some courage to face those animals and do something for her.

This is something that I always tell people. Whenever you see someone or know someone that needs help, don’t think twice. Just do it. It is always the better option amongst the two to help a person out than to not do anything and then regret later.”

“After I graduated out of my tenth grade and one month into my pre university course, I developed high fever and so I went to the doctor for a check-up. This was the first time in fourteen years that I had developed a fever. The medicine that I was given was high dose and due to that my body was swollen. So I went for a second opinion and that doctor told me that I had blood deficiency. So I was given two units of blood but due to some reason that didn’t work out either. It got worse but the doctor told me there was nothing wrong and somewhat neglected the situation. After a few tests they figured out that one of my kidneys had been suffering the third level of infection. I was suffering from a disease called Lupus nephritis. I was under dialysis for three months. I was unconscious for days and the doctor had lost all hopes. He had told that I had ten percent chance of living. I was on ventilator. But then one day I was conscious again, I woke up and started breathing again without the ventilator. I had to go for tests and procedures every day.

It was so frustrating that I used to tell the doctor that I have given up on life and I just want it to end. My parents though kept me positive and told “there are many people in the world who do not have anyone to look up to and literally do not have anything in the world. Be glad that you are recovering and you have people who care for you and love you.” I was still under dialysis but I was recovering so that was good news. Later when I got back to college I heard about Rotaract and was interested to join when I figured the kind of work that happens there. Rotaract has, in a way, given certain purpose to my life and this is one of the things that I wish to live for.

Well I still have certain things to fight against but life now is better with a little bit of more hope around me.”

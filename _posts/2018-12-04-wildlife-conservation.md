4th December is observed as wildlife conservation day. 

Crimes against wildlife(Poaching,Hunting animals) is on the rise in the world and it becomes our moral responsibility to do our bit in preventing this.

Let's create a safe haven for these beautiful creatures and preserve the beauty of nature for our future generations.

Things we can do as individuals:

🐯 When you enter eco sensitive zones do not throw any plastic or waste materials which might cause problems for wildlife.

🦁 While driving in eco sensitive zones make sure to drive slow and well within the limits as wild animals might be crossing the roads.👀

🐻 Awareness is the first step towards conservation. So try to learn about the wild habitat as well as the animals and also spread the word.🎤

🦏 Emphasis on training kids who stay close to the forests on the importance of wildlife habitats as well as species as they will be the potential protectors of the forests. 🐅🐆

Together let's take a step towards positive change

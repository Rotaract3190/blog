I still remember the day I graduated out of my 10th grade. My dad had told me this-You have five years to decide the outcome for the rest of your life. You can work hard for five years and stay happy for the next fifty or you can enjoy the five years and struggle for the next fifty. It’s your decision, choose wisely-and so I’ve kept that in mind ever since and followed his words. He tells-it doesn’t matter if I cannot do good to someone, but doing them wrong would be the biggest sin of my life. He also tells-If I ever get a chance to help someone out, never miss out on that chance because karma always counts.

So with that thought in my mind, I started my pre-graduation course. Here I got introduced to Rotaract. It was by mistake that I joined Rotaract but it is, till date, the best mistake of my life. From then on it has been six years in Rotaract and this journey has been a phenomenal one. It has been an overwhelming journey. A few years back I was a part of a health camp project where we were providing health care services to people from the surrounding rural areas. I was put incharge of the elderly people where in I had to convince them that the operation and check up was completely safe. The innocence in the question that they asked me that day touched my heart and that feeling is unparalleled and unexplainable. All they asked me was a simple question, if the surgery is going to hurt, and that is what moved me. I sat with there for 20 minutes and spoke to them and later, was able to convince them all to undergo the surgery and at the end of the day what I got from this project was a heart full of happiness from the blessings that I had received from everyone there. Honestly, if not for this experience, I don't think I would have been a part of Rotaract or taken Rotaract seriously. 

Lastly, I would again like to repeat my dad's words. It is okay if we are unable to do good to someone but doing someone wrong would be the greatest sin ever. Whenever there's a chance to help a needy, please do so because karma always counts.

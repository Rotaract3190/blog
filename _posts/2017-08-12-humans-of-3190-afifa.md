“In 2014 we (my friends and I) visited Nepal and Darjeeling (which was a college trip) and stayed there for four days. During that time, we absolutely fell in love with the people there and with their kindness and hospitality. In April 2015, the earthquake that struck Nepal was all over the news and evidently the people there suffered a great loss. When we heard about this we were completely disheartened. It was a painful and shocking news. This disaster took place on the last week of April and May 2nd was my eighteenth birthday.

So, I am a person who absolutely loves celebrating birthdays. That year, I had a different thought though. I told my friends that I wanted to celebrate my birthday, not by spending on parties and treats but, by doing something for the people of Nepal who were so humble and kind to us during our visit there. So with a lot of positivity and support, we decided to conduct a collection drive at Cubbon Park where we could collect relief materials like medicine or packed and ready-to-eat food. We did this on the 4th of May because it was a weekend which meant more crowd. I had no clue how but the message of what we were trying to do, spread rapidly and many people came forward to provide for our cause. All I told them was that if they could be so kind to us and take care of us in such a good manner, this is the least we could do for them. After that we all made sure we went to the right place to hand over what we had collected and made sure that it had reached them in proper manner. This was undoubtedly my best and most satisfying birthday ever. – Many a times we spend money carelessly without a second thought about it but there people out there who aren't as lucky as we are. Maybe at times we can spare a thought for them and share with them at least a little of what we have and when we we’d do that, what we’d get in return would be the sight of their happiness and unconditional love and that, is one of the most beautiful things on Earth.”

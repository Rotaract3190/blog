*In a world full of people running races, we need to learn how to run the world with each other.*

The world is divided into two sects of people- the fortunate ones who have the privilege to acquire necessities as well as luxuries of life and the ones who are not fortunate enough in some aspects of their lives to be privileged enough. 
Bridging this gap requires collective efforts and that's how a global voluntary organisation sponsored by Rotary called **Rotaract** came into existence and has been growing at a magnanimous pace since then.

**Rotaract** had it's humble beginning in 1968 initiated by Charlotte North Rotary Club in North Carolina,  USA , as a Rotary International youth program started in order to involve youngsters aged 18 to 30 years in the betterment of society, also mould their personality and make them better humans in tune with the environment and the people around them. 

**Rotaract** which is an acronym for Rotary in action has been in action since more than five decades with the motto of Self-development - Fellowship through service. The collective efforts of more than 2,50,000 Rotaractors have been creating a noticeable impact all over the world but when looked at in a worm's eye view we see approximately 10,904 Rotaract clubs being the building blocks for constructing a world with better people.

In order to accolade the contribution of Rotaract to the world while spreading the message of self-development and social service, we celebrate World Rotaract Day on the 13th of March every year. The icing on this cake is that the week (Monday to Sunday) in which 13th of March falls under is further declared as World Rotaract Week for us to celebrate the glory of Rotaraction.

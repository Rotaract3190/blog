“My story is a very simple one. There was a time when I always dreamt of becoming a doctor but my opinion of doctors changed after a very intense experience that I had as a kid. When I was in the fourth grade, my grandma was diagnosed with colon cancer. My mother was giving her all, to have our grandma with us. Grandma was everything to us. The experiences that my grandma went through during the time of her stay at the hospital made me reflect upon the choice of taking up medicine as a profession. I know it is not right on my part to classify all the doctors as money minded but I definitely have met many of such doctors. In fact, I have met both kinds, doctors who actually care about their patients and doctors who are money minded and only care about the money that they make. Many hospitals are nothing but a source of minting money wherein they suck the life out of their patients and leave them thinking-why did they ever step foot in that place. Such an incident happened to my grandma as well. Once she was discharged out of the hospital, she narrated to us all the bad experience that she went through. It was a nightmare. During her stay at the hospital, she did not even care if she lives or dies, she just wanted to get out of there and get back home.

This is when I thought to myself-helping someone does not necessarily mean taking up medicine or any other related profession; one can help people in their own way. Doing something for people in need wasn’t something that was taught to me, it was something that imbibed into me by my elders. I looked at the way my elders treated people around them and that is how it became a habit. This is when I realised that there are many more people and families that need help and this was one of the reasons I always tried to be a part of social organisations. Being a part of Rotaract gave me a chance at community service. Projects like Pratibha and Handyman’s Project give us a chance to do something for those who generally are neglected. A friend of mine always tells me that the intent of a project is more important than the scale of it and this is something that is fed into my system; it is all about communicating with people and getting to know if something can be done for them and trying to bring a smile on their face.

To conclude, I recall a story in which a girl fakes a tiger attack. Her father rushes to her aid only to find nothing there. This goes on for a couple of times but when a tiger actually attacks her and she calls for help but no one turns up and the father loses his daughter. The moral that people generally draw from this story is that one shouldn’t lie to people but what I draw from this story is very different. What I think is that no matter how many times the daughter had lied, her father could have checked on her. It is always important to have a trusting heart and never give up on someone close to you.”

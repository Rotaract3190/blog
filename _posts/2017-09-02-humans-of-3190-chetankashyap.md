"Before I joined Rotaract, I was a complete introvert. I wouldn't talk to anyone voluntarily or even do things voluntarily for that matter. Later, something struck me and I started thinking that being an introvert is not me; I need some change; let’s try something different. So I joined Rotaract. I just wanted to do something for my community and help out people around me. During my first year in Rotaract, I took part in a lot of projects (almost all) and got the hang of it. In my second year I was given the responsibility of the club secretary and that had a great impact on me. It completely changed me. What I am today completely surprises me.

From being a total introvert to the president of the club, the transformation really surprises me. I have surprised myself and Rotaract has surprised me. It's a give and take process in Rotaract; Rotaract has given to me thrice of what I had to offer to it and I am really happy to be here, in Rotaract."

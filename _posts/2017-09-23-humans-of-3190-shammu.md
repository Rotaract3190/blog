“I love children and I spend time with them whenever I can. When I was in my undergrad, I tutored around thirty kids (from first to tenth grade), who were economically challenged, because it was a good opportunity to spend time with them as well as do something for them. I didn’t charge any fee for this. I focused a lot on their education because they were very weak in academics, few to such an extent that they couldn’t even write proper sentences with a good handwriting. Apart from teaching them, I also organised small events for them like a fancy dress competition. I got good support from a few people, who also wanted to provide education to these kids. I always believed that if I could learn to write and speak proper English, they can do it as well. The only reason they do not is because either they aren’t taught properly and are being neglected or sometimes the teachers themselves do not know how to.

I did this for almost ten months. After ten months I had to discontinue this due to a few problems in the family and my basketball practice but I always told the kids to come to me in case they wanted help with anything but no one showed up. Once the classes stopped I never felt content about doing anything. After a gap of one year I again got back that opportunity to continue what I had left behind at a school called Shishu Mandir. I was allowed to tutor the kids there in the evening and that was one of the best things that had happened to me so far. There were around fifteen children in that school but once I started taking classes there all my thirty children (who I taught previously) came to me again. Later, when we formed the Rotaract club of Shishu Mandir, we took this up as one of our long term projects where every member of the club would spend two to three hours with these kids and help them build on their basics because most of them had problems to even recognise as simple a thing as alphabets. We believe that if we help these kids out, they will be able to help a few other people and this chain reaction might someday eradicate illiteracy. These kids put in a very sincere effort in learning things. Sometimes they have to finish their daily chores so they turn up a little late but they never miss out on the classes. They always tell me - Akka, we aren’t taught this way at any other place and we are ready to learn even on Sundays and on other holidays - and such interest in learning is what keeps us going as well.

I as an individual believe that providing education and knowledge is the best thing to give someone. I believe that it is much better to sit with a child and teach something to the child than to collect funds to provide them with something that is of temporary use to them. Seems like a food for thought?”

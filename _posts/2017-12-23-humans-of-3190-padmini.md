“During my 11th grade, I didn’t have many friends because most of my friends took up commerce and I was stuck with science. Then comes this guy into our college, a new admission. Out of nowhere he confesses to me that he loves me. I ignore. He stalks me, I ignore. He tries to contact me through my friends, I ignore. One day however, I lost my temper and confronted him. Things from there went bad. He started spreading rumors about me, like as though he knew me from the past twelve years. Funny thing was that people actually believed what he said.

That day I figured that whatever one is, however one is, people will believe what they want to. One shouldn’t care about what others have to say about them because no one else knows themselves better than themselves. That day, I believe, I became the strongest girl ever. A lot more things happened after this incident but I could handle those situations easily. Now I talk to people openly without any fear.

This is one story that I love telling to people coz I believe that people should not care about opinions. Opinions don’t define who you are.”

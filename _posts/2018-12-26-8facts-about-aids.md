## Fact 1

#### Aids is caused by HIV

The human immunodeficiency virus, which damages the body's defence system. 

People who have AIDS become weaker because their bodies lose the ability to fight all illnesses. They will eventually die if untreated. 

There is no cure for HIV, but treatment is available to reduce the symptoms so that even people with the virus can have healthy, productive lives.


## Fact 2

#### The onset of AIDS can take up to ten years

The onset of AIDS can take up to ten years from the time of infection with the HIV virus. <br>Therefore a person infected with HIV may look and feel healthy for many years, but he or she can still transmit the virus to someone else. 

New medicines can help a person stay healthier for longer periods of time, but the person will still have HIV.


## Fact 3

#### HIV is transmitted through HIV-infected bodily fluids

HIV is transmitted through HIV-infected bodily fluids. Transfer may occur during all stages of the infection/disease.

The HIV virus is found in the following fluids: blood, semen (and pre ejaculated fluid), vaginal secretions, breast milk.


## Fact 4

#### HIV is most frequently transmitted sexually

HIV is most frequently transmitted sexually. That is because fluids mix and the virus can be exchanged, especially where there are tears in vaginal or anal tissue, wounds or other sexually-transmitted infections (STIs).

Girls are especially vulnerable to HIV infection because their vaginal membranes are thinner and more susceptible to infection than those of mature women.

## Fact 5

#### Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

People who have STIs are at greater risk of being infected with HIV and of transmitting their infection to others. 

People with STIs should seek prompt treatment and avoid sexual intercourse or practice safer sex (non - penetrative sex or sex using a condom), and inform their partners.

## Fact 6

#### The risk of sexual transmission of HIV can be reduced

The risk of sexual transmission of HIV can be reduced if people do not have sex, if uninfected partners have sex only with each other or if people have safer sex -- sex without penetration or using a condom. 

The only way to be completely sure to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV is by abstaining from all sexual contact.

## Fact 7

#### HIV is not transmitted by everyday contact

HIV is not transmitted by: hugging, shaking hands: casual, everyday contact; using swimming pools, toilet seats; sharing bed linens, eating utensils, food; mosquito and other insect bites; coughing, sneezing.

## Fact 8

#### Everyone deserves compassion and support

Discriminating against people who are infected with HIV or anyone thought to be at risk of infection violates individual human rights and endangers public health. 

Everyone infected with and affected by HIV and AIDS deserves compassion and support.

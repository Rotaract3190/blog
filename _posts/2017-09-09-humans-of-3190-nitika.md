"My Dad’s been a Rotarian for 15 years now. So back when I was in Jhansi, I could only picture myself as an Annette (children of Rotarians), and never think of the possibility of ever being a Rotaractor. The kind of work that my Dad has done over the years, the only way of life I had come to know of was one where you help others. I used to visit the Mother Teresa Trust ever since the age of six, which is a home for the orphaned and special needs' children. I didn’t have a clue about what is normal and abnormal. All I could understand was that the children in the 'disabled' ward had the freedom to do whatever they wanted. They could pee in the corridors or scribble on the walls, and no one would stop them. I used to wonder– "What would it be to live such a life." At that moment, I wanted to be one of them. I wanted to live their life, free from all the unwanted restrictions, responsibilities and competitions of the world. Their life wasn’t like that of a “normal” person who was cluttered with all the complications of life, that he built for himself. I wanted to be “abnormal”. However, it was only when I studied Psychology I realised what it really means to be different. I was ashamed to romanticise disability.

People take everything for granted and that is something I learned, not only as a part of my academics, but also through life. Back when I was in Delhi, I was living in a bubble; free floating through life. I had forgotten that I am responsible for something; for someone. I had taken life for granted, and it gave me a slap right back for doing so. I graduated from Delhi University, as well as Delhi, the capital city, that had taught me greater lessons.

I had to detox myself from all that had happened. I came to Bangalore for my Masters, with lost hope and an under average degree. I did my best, not for myself, but for my parents whom I had let down the most. I remember on the day of convocation, when I presented my Gold Medal to my mother, I swear I had never seen her happier.

Now, I have come a full circle. What I started with, is what I have become. I work with Special Needs' Children and this is what makes me the happiest, not that accolade. When I get back home after work, I have a feeling of joy and satisfaction. When I reflect back on my day and think that my autistic kid spoke his name today because of me, I know I have amounted to something good. And this feeling, this very heart touching feeling, is what keeps me going."

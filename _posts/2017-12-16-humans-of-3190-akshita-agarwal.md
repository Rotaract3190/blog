“Before we got installed this year, we had organised a Hip-Hop workshop. We believed this would promote the fun side of Rotaract. The event was well promoted and had a lot of participants registered for it. However, on the day of event, the instructor informed to us about his unavailability. The immediate and obvious reaction would be to panic. We did not know what to do and so we huddled up and started making some calls. Finally my instructor was able to arrange for an instructor who came down and taught us and we could finally pull off the event.

The first instructor’s behavior was totally unprofessional. He was someone I knew and that, only made it worst. But when people you know very well are sometimes capable disowning you or letting you down and they do so, there is always someone who would come around and help you out.

Never give up and always hope for the best.”

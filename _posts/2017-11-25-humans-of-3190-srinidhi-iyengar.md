“This dates back to when I was pursuing my undergrad. Back then I always felt cozy inside my comfort zone and so I never put in an effort to get out of it and do something else. My life seemed to follow the same routine every day but life is not always about stability. When I was selected for the Indian Taekwondo team, my mother was diagnosed with a multi organ failure. She was admitted to a hospital and I still remember that to be one of the worst phases of my life. I had to now not only manage my studies but also manage things at home as well. Initially I struggled but later my mother told me something that has become one of the strongest principles of my life. She said to me that “You have to learn to adapt to situations and learn to cope up with them. Earlier you were playing a role of the son at home but now you have to take up the role of the mother as well.”

That has moulded to what I have become today. I got out of my comfort zone and started doing things that I never imagined I would. Today I am not only a student but also an International Level Taekwondo Gold Medalist, an air pistol shooter and a Rotaractor. I also actively participate in a lot of clubs and forums and I recently was announced the winner of “Mr. Popularity” at Mr. Best Icon India South 2017.

One should be like water-adopting to its surroundings and cutting through obstacles. Multitasking is something that drives me and I always try and emphasise its importance. People should always be multitasking and should gain the ability to adopt to any situation that might sometime lead to an unplanned risk and this is what I strongly believe.”
